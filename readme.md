## 📢 News

- **2025.05.23** 🎉 We are very proud to launch MMMR, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking. We release the [arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16459) and MMMR dataset in [huggingface dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/csegirl/MMMR).

## 📘 About MMMR-Bench

Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled unified processing of language, vision, and structured inputs, opening the door to complex tasks such as logical deduction, spatial reasoning, and scientific analysis. Despite their promise, the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs—particularly those augmented with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T)—remain poorly understood and lack standardized evaluation benchmarks. Existing work focuses primarily on perception or final answer correctness, offering limited insight into how models reason or fail across modalities. 

To address this gap, we introduce the **MMMR**, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking.

## The composition of MMMR
1) a high-difficulty dataset of **1,083** questions spanning **six** diverse reasoning types with symbolic depth and multi-hop demands。

2) a modular **Reasoning Trace Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP)** for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy through metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotation.

## The Evaluation of MMMR

This benchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and provides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development.

our evaluation pipeline comprises three core stages: **(I) Reasoning Dataset Construction**, **(II) Thinking Quality Assessment**, and **(III) Reasoning Insights Synthesis**.

## Evaluation

To calculate the precision, please follow the following steps:
1. Install the required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Fill the model config file

```bash
cd config
```

create your model config file as the form of sample.json.

3. Run the evaluation scripts

Run the evaluation with the based prompt

```bash
cd code
python Based_prompt.py --model_config <your model path> --task_config_file <the dataset json file path> --test_num <test number> --results_file <your results path>
```

Run the evaluation with the reasoing prompt (with models who have reasoing content)

```bash
cd code
python Reasoning_prompt.py --model_config <your model path> --task_config_file <the dataset json file path> --test_num <test number> -results_file <your results path>
```

Finally, you can fing your results in the results path.
